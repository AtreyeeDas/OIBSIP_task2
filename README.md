Internship on Android Application Development - A To Do App

This application as the name suggests will be a To-Do list holding app. Itâ€™ll
store the users schedules and their upcoming meetings or events. In this
application, users will be enabled to write their important notes as well. To
make it safe, we can provide a login page before the user can access it.
